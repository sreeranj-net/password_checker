# Password Strength Checker

This is a small Python script I made to check how strong a password is.
It checks common things like length, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

I created this mainly to understand basic password rules and regex usage.

## How it works
The script gives a score based on different conditions and then classifies the
password as weak, medium, or strong. If the password is weak, it also shows
some suggestions.

## How to run

Make sure Python is installed.

```bash
python password_checker.py

# simple checks, not meant to be perfect
